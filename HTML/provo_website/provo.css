/*
I've departed from convention in writing this CSS file.
Rather than organizing it into categories as most coders
do, I've followed the sequence of the HTML, building it in
the same steps that I built the HTML pages. I did this because
I think it'll be easier for you to follow. For the same reason,
I avoided grouping selectors that share the same styling.
(See Chapter 20.) This creates some redundant code, but
I'm going for clarity here, not economy.

To run tests:
Run 'nosetests' from the project root dir (not from the tests/ subdir).
Actually, nose isn't actively maintained, so we'll use pytest.
Run 'pytest' from the project root dir.
	This will run test_* functions in **/test_*.py files.

You can use setup.py to turn your project into a pip package.

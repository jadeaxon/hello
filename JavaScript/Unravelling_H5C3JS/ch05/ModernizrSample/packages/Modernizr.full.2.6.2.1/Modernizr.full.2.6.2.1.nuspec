    <description>I created this nuget package so that there would be a version available for NuGet that has everything including yepnope.js so that Modernizr.load works.

Modernizr adds classes to the &lt;html&gt; element which allow you to target specific browser functionality in your stylesheet. You don't actually need to write any Javascript to use it.
        Modernizr is a small and simple JavaScript library that helps you take advantage of emerging web technologies (CSS3, HTML5) while still maintaining a fine level of control over older browsers that may not yet support these new technologies.</description>

  <h2>Visual Studio Extensibility</h2>
  <p>
    I have read a great article about 
    Visual Studio Extensibility. What into 
    my brain have come after reading this 
    article was the
    <q cite="http://magazine.com/Article.html">thousand
      ways of extension</q>
    that Visual Studio Provides.
  </p>
  <p>I've found this especially important:</p>
  <blockquote cite="http://magazine.com/Article.html">
    Because Visual Studio has been architected
    with extensibility in mind, the question
    is not whether there are appropriate
    extension points for a feature of your imagination.
    The real question is what those points are and
    how you can add your features.

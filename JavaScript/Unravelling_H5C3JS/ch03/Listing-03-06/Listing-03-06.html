      <h1>Visual Studio Platform and Extensibility</h1>

        <h2>Thousand ways of extension</h2>
        <p>
          Well I know, it is an exaggeration to tell about 
          &quot;a thousand ways&quot; when treating Visual Studio 
          extensibility, but I'd like to point out that you 
          have many choices. In this part I show you how many 
          options you have when dealing with adding some extra 
          stuff to Visual Studio. Reference materials, books, 
          and articles generally enumerate about a dozen options. 
          Instead of simply telling you what they are I would 
          like to methodize them. The key to understand 
          extensibility options is the architecture of 
          the Visual Studio IDE
          (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>)

        <figure id="figure1">
          <a href="Figure1.gif" target="_blank">
            <img src="Figure1.gif" width="307" height="118" />
          </a>

            Figure 1: Visual Studio IDE
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          When running the Visual Studio IDE we start the devenv.exe
          file. However, the IDE we see and work with is not 
          just a simple monolithic .exe file or an executable 
          divided into a few .dll files. It is a shell that 
          provides a graphical environment to host functional 
          units, called packages. What we perceive is a cooperation 
          of the shell and hosted packages. The core functions 
          of the IDE are also implemented in packages including 
          the C# or Visual Basic project types, testing features, 
          and many more. The majority of third-party extensions 
          loaded into Visual Studio are also implemented in packages. 
          Just to give you a feeling about how many of them are used: 
          in my notebook I counted 129 packages including those 
          installed with Visual Studio 2008 and third-parties.

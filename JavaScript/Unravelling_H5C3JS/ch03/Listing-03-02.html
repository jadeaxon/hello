          Now there is a rapidly growing community,
          the Visual Studio Ecosystem behind Visual Studio.
          With any idea, imaginings, issues, or questions,
          you can turn to other community members and
          leverage the knowledge they have. Welcome to
          the world of VSX!

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          As a .NET architect and developer I cannot imagine
          my everyday work without Visual Studio. I was
          always in a strange excitement when waiting for
          a new CTP, Beta or RTM of Visual Studio because
          I always expected some great new features with
          every release. During the years I have bought a
          few third-party add-ins and utilities for Visual
          Studio to make my development tasks easier and
          even created small add-ins to produce some useful
          piece of code. I knew that Visual Studio was
          extensible; I downloaded the SDKs and tried to
          get familiar with those hundreds of extensibility
          interfaces. However, due to lack of good
          documentation I often got frustrated.

        <h2>Visual Studio: Extensible Platform</h2>
        <p>
          Hearing the word &quot;extensibility&quot;
          a developer always starts to think &quot;
          some API allowing extra functionality to be
          added to a product&quot;. More or less,
          I can agree with this definition in the case
          of Visual Studio. In this part I tell you how
          I understand Visual Studio extensibility, and
          what are the ways we can add functionality. Because
          I started learning this story with the release of
          Visual Studio 2008, I put the focus on that version.

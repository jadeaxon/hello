<!-- This uses a different controller than the home page view. -->
<!-- But, they both link back to the same city value in the shared service. -->
<h3>Forecast for {{ city }}</h3>

<!-- It takes a while to fetch the weather data from the weather service. -->
<!-- Using ng-cloak prevenst this div from displaying until {{ weatherResult.main.temp }} has an actual value. -->
<!-- Without this you'll see it glitch with the {{ ... }} string as a literal value. -->
<!-- This does not seem to be working though. -->
<div ng-cloak>
  The current temperature is <span ng-cloak>{{ weatherResult.main.temp }}</span>Â°F.
</div>

      <dt>King</dt>
      <dd>
        The king moves one square in any direction. 
        The king has also a special move which is called 
        castling and involves also moving a rook.
      </dd>
      <dt>Rook</dt>
      <dd>
        The rook can move any number of squares along 
        any rank or file, but may not leap over other 
        pieces. Along with the king, the rook is 
        involved during the king's castling move.

      <dt>Bishop</dt>
      <dd>
        The bishop can move any number of squares 
        diagonally, but may not leap over other pieces.

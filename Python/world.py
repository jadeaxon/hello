#!/usr/bin/env python
# The above shebang line tells the shell (such as bash) which program to use to interpret this script.
# The above shebang line must have no trailing space.
    # Otherwise you might see this: /usr/bin/env: python : No such file or directory
# The above shebang line is more portable because it will locate python on most machines.

# chmod 755 this script so it is executable.
# Use ./hello_world.py to invoke it: this directory may not be in your PATH environment variable.
# Make sure it has Unix line endings (\n), not Windows line endings (\r\n).

print "Hello, world!"

# This is what you should see:
# $ ./hello_world.py
# Hello, world!
